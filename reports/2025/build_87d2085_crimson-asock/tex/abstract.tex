  In this brief report we show the performance scaling as incrementing the number of reactors for a single OSD, 
  for Crimson SeaStore using the following configurations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item we ranged the number of Seastar reactors as 4, 8, 16 and 56. 
    \item All configurations used a single NUMA socket.
    \item We used the same ceph dev build from main branch (hash 87d2085) for all test runs.
    \item We only used the balanced OSD algorithm.
  \end{itemize}
Our preliminary conclusions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The performance of the Crimson SeaStore on random workloads scales
      well with the number of reactors. However, sequential workloads don't scale well beyond 16 reactors. 
    \item We are using flamegraphs data for 4 and 8 reactors to work out attribution on the hottest code paths.
  \end{itemize}
