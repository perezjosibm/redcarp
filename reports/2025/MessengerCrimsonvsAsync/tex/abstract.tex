  In this brief report we summarise the performance results for the comparison
  between the Crimson vs. the Asynchronous Messenger.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We used the same ceph dev build from main branch (hash b1e4a2b) for both.
    \item We ranged over the number of clients, which matches the associated number of CPU cores.
    \item We used the two classes of CPU core allocation, namely Balanced and Separated.
  \end{itemize}
Our conclusions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The Separated CPU allocation shows a better performance than the Balanced allocation.
    \item The Crimson Messenger shows a better performance than the Asynchronous Messenger.
  \item The results suggest the prescence of bottlenecks associated when
    increasing the number of CPU cores, which remains to be investigated
      further.
  \end{itemize}
