  In this brief report we show the performance comparisonm between the two
  Seastore cache pinboard algorithms, namely LRU and 2Q. We used the following
  configurations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item we used a single RBD volume of size 2 GB (which is the default size of the cache per reactor).
    \item We ranged the number of Seastar reactors as 1, 4, and 8 (to show scalability).
    \item We used the same ceph dev build from main branch (hash ab72fd0620f) for all test runs.
    \item All configurations used balanced OSD algorithm on a single NUMA socket (this is to be consistent with previous tests).
    \item We used three random distributions via FIO options, namely: normal (Gaussian), zoned, and Zipfian.
  \end{itemize}
Our preliminary conclusions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The performance of the two pinboard cache algorithms do not show a
      significant difference, either in throughput or latency, nor in CPU
      resource utilisation.
    \item As expected from previous tests, Crimson SeaStore on random workloads scales
      well with the number of reactors.
  \end{itemize}
