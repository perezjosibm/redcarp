  In this brief report we summarise the performance results for the comparison
  between the Crimson SeaStore using the following configurations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item single Seastar reactor per physical core: up to 28 reactors, single NUMA socket,
    \item dual Seastar reactor per physical core: up to 56 reactors, single NUMA socket.
    \item We used the same ceph dev build from main branch (hash 6aab5c07ae) for both.
    \item We only used the balanced OSD algorithm.
  \end{itemize}
Our preliminary conclusions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The performance of the Crimson SeaStore using the dual Seastar
	reactor per physical core achieves better performance across the four typical workloads. 
  This suggest that Seastar is HT-friendly in the sense that reactors don't
      seem to interfere each other use of the physical CPU.
  \end{itemize}
